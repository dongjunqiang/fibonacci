# Golang Project Sample - Fibonacci Calculator

*The project is not ready for production. It is still experimental and subject to change.*

Fibonacci Calculator calculates n-th Fibonacci number. It computes Fibonacci numbers in time O(log(n))
and uses 'Rising a matrix to the power' method. 

Algorithm is implemented in library but you also can use utility 'fib' 
to calculate Fibonacci numbers using command-line. 

## Key Features

* Fast computation algorithm in time O(log(n));
* Almost constant memory usage.
